# *phpQuery*
The  PHP DOM Manipulation toolkit.

## Motivation

I'm working currently with PHP, and I've missed using something like jQuery in PHP to manipulate the DOM. Therefore, I started doing it by myself. I'll improve this, step by step, to make it look like JavaScript's jQuery.

## Context

There's a main PHP HTML document ```mainDoc``` that calls another PHP document ```anotherDoc``` to populate it.
As we use either ```print``` or ```echo``` for returning strings to a PHP GET require, ```anotherDoc``` uses ***phpQuery*** to create HTML elements and return it to ```mainDoc```. This is a more tidy-up way I found to do it instead of passing raw HTML strings to variables and concatenating it.

## Current status

It looks more like Java than with JavaScript ðŸ˜‚

The main class created here that serves for basic uses, like creating headers and stuff, is the ```DOM_Element```.
You create it inputting the HTML item **type** you're creating (such as ```h2``` or ```img```), an array of **attributes** (like ```style``` or ```class```), in *name-value* order, and the element's **content** (such as text or other stuff).

It has *get* and *set* methods as OOP requires, so you can get the attributes array and the content quite easily.

To render it on the browser, every ```DOM_Element``` has a function ```constructHTML()``` where it returns a String ```<type attr="value">content</type>```.

## Contribute

### Testing

Run XAMPP, so it will run PHP on your local machine. (Don't have it? Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html)!)
Store this project insied *htdocs* folder (usually on C:\xampp on Windows. Dunno how it is on Mac or Linux)

Open localhost on your browser and put */phpQueryTest.php* in the end of the URL.
It will show a test HTML document I've made to show the *phpQuery* working.

### Editing

You can edit *phpQuery.php* to edit the classes I did, and edit *phpContent.php* to test its behavior.
*IMPORTANT: Use Ctrl+F5 to update the page, since that this command reloads all the resources.*
